This is a simple and fun Snake game implemented in Java. The game is designed using Java Swing for the graphical interface and utilizes basic Java concepts such as event handling, arrays, and timers. It includes custom graphics for the snake and its movement, as well as an enemy (food) for the snake to consume in order to grow and score points.

Features
Snake Movement: The snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, right) and grows in length when it eats food.
Score Tracking: The score increases as the snake consumes food, and the length of the snake also increases.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself.
Restart: Press the space bar to restart the game after a Game Over.
Graphics: Custom images are used for the snake's head, body, and food.
How to Play
Use Arrow Keys: Control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right).
Eat Food: The snake will grow and the score will increase as it consumes the food.
Avoid Collisions: Don't let the snake run into itself or out of bounds.
Restart: Press the space bar after the game ends to start a new game.
